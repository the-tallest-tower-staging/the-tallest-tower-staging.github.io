<h1>404: Page not found</h1>

<h3>:(</h3>

<p>
  Your best bet is to head back to the <a href="{{ site.url }}">home page</a> to find what you're looking for. Give me a shout at <a href="mailto:thetallesttowergame@gmail.com">thetallesttowergame@gmail.com</a> if you think this page really should exist.

  Or, you could take this opportunity to reflect on your life, and the choices that led you here. Why did you try to go somewhere you couldn't? Is it a deep-seated yearning to explore the unknown? Or a malicious craving to break everything you touch? Did a shady friend send you this link, hoping to lead you astray for their own twisted amusement?

<p>
  Or you made a type, I guess that could be it too.
