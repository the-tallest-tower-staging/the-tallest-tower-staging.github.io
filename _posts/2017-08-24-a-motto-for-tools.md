When writing tools, keep the following motto close to your heart:

> Do your job, then get out of the way.

We all know what it looks like when you don't follow this rule. You get Adobe Creative Cloud. You get that tool you downloaded for a one-time filetype conversion, only to find the tool wanted to scan your entire computer first, set up an auto-updating system, subscribe you to its newsletter, and give you handy-dandy tips every time you open the tool.

Think back to all the times you've been frustrated by a tool that assumed it was the center of the universe. Where it felt like author took every opportunity to remind you how awesome the tool was, and all the amazing things the tool can do that you never wanted or needed.

It sucks, right? Don't do that.

A critical skill of a good software developer is the ability to think like the user. Pretend you're some person that just wants to convert three PNGs to JPGs so you can email your mom photos of your dog. What is the software that would best allow you to accomplish this goal? If this is you, do you care at all about reading startup tips? Are you willing to wait around for five minutes while the tool scans your filesystem for images?

The best tools I use are very specialized. They have one job, and they do it really damned well. If you want to write a good tool, this is a valuable mindset to take. Not only will it make your tool better at its job, but it will help you fight scope creep, eliminate features that aren't actually needed, keep the UI simple and focused, and keep your software lightweight and trim (and probably fast too). There's nothing wrong with having many sharp, specialized tools, each finely-tuned for one particular job. I'd rather that over one tool that does a mediocre job at many things. I call this collection of tools my _programmer toolbelt_. There's a reason carpenters carry a hammer, and a drill, and a nailgun, and a saw, and a framing square, and a tape measure...

You hit a hotkey, the window pops up. You type until you see what you want, then select it. The file opens. Everything closes, because its work is now done. Simple. It does its job, then gets out of the way. Everything has been part of my programming toolbelt ever since my first job in the game industry, and its adherence to this motto is a big part of why it works so well.
