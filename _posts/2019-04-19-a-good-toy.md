>To design a good puzzle, first build a good toy.

By this point there's a large body of best practices for puzzle games. A puzzle game should be a thorough exploration of a mechanic or idea, each puzzle should explore something new, all pieces of information required to solve a puzzle should be easily and immediately obvious. That kind of stuff. But a concept I often don't see explored is the concept of a puzzle as a toy.

My hypothesis is that this is a key difference between a hardcore puzzle game and a more mainstream one. It's not necessarily just the difficulty of the puzzle. It's that a hardcore puzzle game has puzzles and nothing else, and perhaps puzzles that aren't that fun to play around with devoid of a goal. A more mainstream puzzle game can be just as long, or just as challenging, or explore mechanics and ideas in just thet same way. The main difference is that a mainstream puzzle game tends to have a good toy.

Or put another way: A mainstream puzzle game has good hook.

I'll examine a few puzzle games I've played and evaluate how they function as a toy. Bear in mind, these are all _outstanding_ puzzle games, regardless of the critique I'm about to lay out. There are many great puzzle games that lack a good toy that are well worth playing. It's just that a good toy can propel forward the lasting appeal and mind-bendingness of a game, and significantly broaden the appeal of a puzzle game without needing concessions to its complexity or difficulty.
