>To design a good puzzle, first build a good toy.

>    [_-Scott Kim_](http://www.scottkim.com.previewc40.carrierzone.com/thinkinggames/whatisapuzzle/index.html)

We know a lot by now about how to make a good puzzle game. Thoroughly explore a specific mechanic or idea. Make each puzzle teach something new about that idea. All information required to solve a puzzle should be immediately and obviously communicated. That kind of stuff. Much exists on those topics that can be read in detail elsewhere. But a concept I often don't see explored is the concept of a puzzle as a toy.

My hypothesis is that the quality of a puzzle's toy is a key difference between a hardcore puzzle game and a more mainstream one. It's not necessarily just the difficulty of the puzzle. It's that a hardcore puzzle game has puzzles and nothing else, and perhaps puzzles that aren't that fun to play around with devoid of a goal. A more mainstream puzzle game can be just as long, or just as challenging, or explore mechanics and ideas in just thet same way. The main difference is that a mainstream puzzle game tends to have a good toy.

Or put another way: A hardcore puzzle game has challenging, interesting puzzles. A good mainstream puzzle game has all that too, it just also has a good hook.

You can evaluate a puzzle game's toy by thinking how the game would play with the levels removed. Throw the player in an empty stage with no goal. How enjoyable is this? What can they learn and discover just from messing around? How satisfying is this process? Think about what this would look like for a game like Portal versus a game like Stephen's Sausage Roll.

I'll examine a few puzzle games I've played and evaluate how they function as a toy. Bear in mind, these are all _outstanding_ puzzle games, regardless of the critique I'm about to lay out. These are among the best puzzle games I've ever played, and even those that lack a good toy are still well worth playing.

Also I'll spoil some details about these games. Consider yourself warned.


##Portal

Portal is probably the best example of a toy I could think of. Throw a player in an empty room with a portal gun, and they will immediately start figuring out what's going on.

A huge part of the appeal of this toy hinges on a couple details:
- First person
- You can see through a portal
Remove either of those and it becomes significantly less mind bending. The aesthetics of portals and how you interact with them are crucial for creating a satisfying and mind-bending toy.


##Braid

Good toy. Again, depends heavily on aesthetics, namely the music and sound playing in reverse, and complex particle effects and visual details moving backwards.


##FEZ

Decent toy. Takes a while to get to the toy though.


##Antichamber

More a collection of toys around a central theme.


##The Swapper

Not a great toy, but there's a little bit there.


##Snakebird

No toy. Aesthetics are good, but very mobile-esque. Can lead people to think this game will play like a much more casual game than it actual is. Despite it's childish facade, it is a hardcore puzzle game among the ranks of the Stephen's Sausage Rolls of the world.


##The Witness

Basically no toy. The environmental puzzles have the marginal feeling of a toy, but hardly.


##Stephen's Sausage Roll

No toy. Also not great aesthetics.


##Baba Is You

Outstanding toy. Remarkable because it doesn't lean on aesthetics.
