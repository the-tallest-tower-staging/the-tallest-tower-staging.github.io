Welcome to the development blog for The Tallest Tower!

Over the last few years, I've been doing some thinking about stories in games. I have a lot of thoughts about a particular kind of game I'd like to see made, and how story can be entwined into the experience in interesting ways. When I look around, I see the occasional game demonstrating bits and pieces of what I have in mind. But no game yet has fully captured what I have in mind.

So, I'm going to make it.

I have a full time job as a programmer, so I'll be developing this in my spare time. I already have the basics of an engine and the first parts of the game up and running. But it is very much a simple prototype at this stage. Slowly, but surely, that will change, as the game grows and evolves over the coming months.

The title "The Tallest Tower" will certainly change before the game is done, but I needed a working title for the project. So, there you have it. No guarantee of towers in the final game, tall or otherwise.

I'll add a comments section to the site eventually. But until then, shoot me an email at thetallesttowergame@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments.

In short, welcome. I'm glad you've come along for the ride, and I'm excited to see where this adventure takes us.
