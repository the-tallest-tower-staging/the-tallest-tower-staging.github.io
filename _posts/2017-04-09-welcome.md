Welcome to the development blog for The Tallest Tower!

This is a game based on some thinking I've been doing about stories in games. I have a lot of thoughts about the kinds of games I'd like to see made, and how story can be entwined into a game in interesting ways. When I look around though, I see very few games that look like what I'm imagining. So, I guess that means I'm going to make one.

I have a fulltime job as a programmer so I'll be working on this in my spare time. Be warned, progress will be _painfully_ slow. I already have the basics of an engine, and the first parts of the game up and running. But it is very much a simple prototype at this stage.

The title "The Tallest Tower" will certainly change before the game is done. It'll do as a working title for now I suppose.

I'll add a comments section to the site eventually. But until then, shoot me an email at thetallesttowergame@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments about the game.

I look forward to embarking on this adventure together with you.
