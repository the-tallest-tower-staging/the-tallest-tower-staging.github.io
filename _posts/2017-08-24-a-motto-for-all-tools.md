When writing tools, keep the following motto close to your heart:

> Do your job, then get out of the way.

We all know what it looks like when you don't follow this. You get Adobe Creative Cloud. Or some tool you downloaded for a one-time edit to a particular filetype, only to find the tool first wanted to scan your entire computer, set up an auto-updating system, subscribe you to its newsletter, and give you handy-dandy tips every time you open the tool.

Think back to all the times you've been frustrated by a tool that assumed it was the center of the universe. Where it was clear that the author wanted to take every opportunity to remind you how awesome the tool is, and use your valuable time to list all the features it has that you don't care about.

Good. Now don't do that.

A critical skill of a good software developer is the skill of pretending you are the user. Think like them. You're just some person that wants to convert three PNGs to JPGs so you can email your mom photos of your dog. What is the software that would best allow you to accomplish this goal?

The best tools I have used have been very specialized. They have only one job, and they do it really damned well.

Case study: [Everything Search](http://www.voidtools.com). You hit a hotkey, the window pops up. You type until you see what you want, then select it. The file opens. Everything closes, because its work is now done. Simple. It does what I need it to, then gets out of my way. Which really is all I want from my search program.
